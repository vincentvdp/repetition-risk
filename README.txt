## Analysis summary:
In our thesis named "Prediction and Prevention: Reducing Repetition & Dropout of Primary Students in Rwanda", we use machine learning and predictive modeling in Python to predict the repetition and dropout risk for individual pupils in Rwandan primary schools. Distilling a simplified scorecard from this model allows school and community based scorecard creation. Such a scorecard could (1) help teachers identify at risk kids and take discretionary action, or (2) improve targeting of remedial programs.
This analysis makes use of publicly available Rwandan Integrated Household Data (http://www.statistics.gov.rw/data-portals). The output is an easy-to-use proof-of-concept scorecard to asses Rwandan primary school pupils' risk of repetition.
